## Background
In 90's taking notes used to be so simple. You’d take out a sheet of parchment, dip your quill in ink, and get to writing.
Then a bunch of nerds got together and started inventing things – and that’s when note-taking got complicated. Suddenly we had to choose from different models of typewriters and competing keyboard layouts.
Then we got our mobile phones which have a large range of apps available for taking notes which allows you to write wherever you are.
